Include a very brief summary of your project here and what you changed / added to assignment #3. 
My project is an application in which the user can input their favorite games with their total playtime and compare how much time they've spent on it compared to other users.
The main change from assignment #3 is that I decided to remove the local-passport authentication since I was having issues when having both github authentication and local-passport authentication.
Though I believe I've fixed all the issues I won't be adding local-passport for this assignment, I will probably add it to the next assignment if we continue with these applications.
Also the project is now using the React framework.

Unlike previous assignments, this assignment will be solely graded on whether or not you successfully complete it. Partial credit will be generously given.
